# Yolov3-Underwater-Detection

The Project is somewhat close to my heart, it was my final year project. I trained the model on dataset I received from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-NOAA  (https://coast.noaa.gov/states/hawaii.html). This uses the YOLO v3 model which is a real-time object detection algorithm that uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). They had a team that was already working on this but without much success and were kind enough to share their data https://swfscdata.nmfs.noaa.gov/Labeled-fishes-in-the-wild/. Unfortunately I cannot share the code itself as it is quite large. But here is a sample of the algorithm detecting a shark from a fish. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xMYcmtoI2bVgaX5GggKpVjH2D3WkB0jR/view?usp=drive_link
